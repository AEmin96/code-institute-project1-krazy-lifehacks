 <h2> Testing </h2>
 
 <p> This website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Microsoft Edge. </p>
 <p> This website was tested and confirmed that it's responsive and all functions worked well on several devices.</p>
 <p> <em> <strong> The form is all set-up, however, currently it only has a JavaScript response since Github Pages does not support server side programs  </strong> </em> </p>
  
  
 <h2> Bugs </h2>
 <h3> Solved Bugs </h3>
<p> When I first created this website, I was only previewing my changes on full resolution. When I started resizing my screen to check how responsive it is, all of my elements were getting squished and some of them were disappearing from the screen. </p>
<p> I solved this problem by creating a new branch and debugged all of my size properties. Once all of my elements became responsive, I rebased my branch and now everything works fine.
