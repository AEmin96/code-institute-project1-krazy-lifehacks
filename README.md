<h2>Deployment:</h2>

<p><strong>The website has been successfully deployed using GitHub Pages, providing easy access to users.</strong></p>
Here are the steps I took to deploy my website using GitHub Pages:

1. Create a GitHub Repository: I started by creating a new repository on GitHub. I logged into my GitHub account, clicked on the "+ New" button on the top right corner of my dashboard, and provided a name for my repository.

2. Write the Code: Once the repository was created, I wrote all the necessary code for my website. This included HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, images, and any other assets required for my website to function properly.

3. Configure Repository Settings: To enable GitHub Pages for my repository, I went to the repository's "Settings" tab, scrolled down to the "GitHub Pages" section, and chose the branch I wanted to deploy (usually the main branch or gh-pages branch). I saved my changes.

4. Verify Deployment: GitHub Pages then built and deployed my website. Once the process was completed, I visited the link provided in the "GitHub Pages" section of my repository's settings to verify that my website was live and accessible.

5. Update and Maintain: With my website now deployed, I can continue to make updates to my code and push changes to the repository. GitHub Pages automatically reflects these changes on my live website. I'll be sure to regularly maintain and update my site as needed.
